## London Metropolitan Police Stop and Search Visualization
### 
##### Fani Sentinella-Jerbić, Ana Terović, 2023

Police are arguably one of the pillars of a peaceful and righteous modern life. Sometimes, in order to protect the rights of the majority, police need to violate the rights of certain individuals, such as the right to privacy and freedom of movement. These types of operations are often referred to as *stop and search* actions. However, certain police forces are abusing their authority by stopping and searching people in a way that is discriminatory.

We tried to approach this issue from a data-driven standpoint. The data we used is provided by the [London Metropolitan Police](https://data.police.uk/about/) and includes all stop and search actions from the 1st of June 2021 to the 1st of July 2021. We offered a visualization which could be used by the police professionals in order to improve their operations. By informing criminal justice and law enforcement professionals of their biases, gaps, and errors in past operations, they could improve their operations in the future. Ultimately, this would lead to better crime prevention and protection of the general public.
